Changes for part 2

The refactoring of our original code from part 1 in preparation of building the GUI can be split up
into two parts.

For one, we created a new read-only model interface called ReadOnlyNUPlanner which only contains
two methods, both being observation methods. One returning a copy of the list of schedules and the
other returning the list of user names. The ReadOnlyPlannerModel class implements this interface
and takes in two constructors, either a list of schedules or a NUPlanner. The original NUPlanner
now extends from this ReadOnlyNUPlanner interface.

The second change we made comes from the checklist where we added new constructors to our
plannermodel class to allow for the creation of the a planner that takes in either a list of files
or a list of schedules. The constructor that takes in a list of schedules has a boolean flag
"test" since it will most likely only be used for testing. The list of files constructor uses
a reader to read in the xml files to the database.

Changes for part 3

Unfortunately I was not able to get much done, finished all of assignment 6 pretty much with a new
screenshot showing how that was completed. I created behavior for all buttons and the ability
to for events to be seen on the planner. The event and file frames are accessed by pressing buttons
on the planner panel, the event panel prints details of the removed/created events.

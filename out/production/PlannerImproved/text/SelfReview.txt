After reviewing their code. I wished we did what they did with their day class. I believe that
having the numerical value stored would've made our code a lot more convenient and easy to work
with. Other than that I do not think there is many things I wish I did that they did (other than
complete their controller implementation and refactor into features properly). Overall, although I
did not fully implement my code, I can see exactly how much goes into working with previously
designed code and refactoring it to work within your code. It was also very interesting to see
the differences between our code and theirs and I was even able to get some ideas from it.
